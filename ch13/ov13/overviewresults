1. what inherited class get from base class
=> public methods,public members, protected members.
=> acces the private members indirectly by the public methods.


2. what inherited it can't get from base
=> private members and methods
=>constructor,destructor, assignment operator.

3. if BaseDMA::operator=() returns void? or returns BaseDMA &
=>if returns void, the signle assign is ok but cant continue assgin.

4. will cal base cases constructor by the order. desconstuctor is in reverse, first the drived then it's base.

5. constructor can't be inherited. it needs and compiler will have a default one. but need one even it's empty.

6. it will call drived class's method.

7. it has new operator.

8. can assign drived class object to a base pointer. can't assign base class object to drived object pointer.


9. yes. no

10. yes


11. yes. pass by vuall will call the copy constructor. as parameter is base ojbect, i will call base's copy constructor. and 




12. don't need to call copy consturctor. don't need to call descructor.

13.  normal method: itiwll call base's head. virutal: it will call drived base method.
